# Customer Service AI Agent

This repository contains the code and resources for a Customer Service AI Agent that utilizes Language Models (LLMs) to provide automated support during phone calls.

## Overview

The Customer Service AI Agent follows a simple workflow:

1. Speech-to-Text Conversion: The customer's speech is converted into text using a speech recognition system.
2. Language Model Processing: The converted text is passed through a Language Model to generate an appropriate response.
3. Text-to-Speech Synthesis: The generated response is converted into speech using a text-to-speech synthesis system.
4. Response Delivery: The synthesized speech is played back to the customer during the call.

## Usage

To use the Customer Service AI Agent, follow these steps:

1. Set up the necessary speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis systems.
2. Install the required dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the main script, `main.py`, which handles the speech-to-text conversion, language model processing, and text-to-speech synthesis.
```bash
python main.py
```

4. Connect the agent to the phone call system to enable real-time interaction with customers.

## Customization

The behavior of the Customer Service AI Agent can be customized by modifying the language model and fine-tuning it on specific customer service domains. Additionally, the speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis systems can be replaced with alternative implementations based on specific requirements.
